sjmorph.model for udpipe (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe) is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3236528

We obtain 99.88% f1 score for segmentation and 94.75% accuracy for POS tagging for Sejong tag sets.


## history
[new, October 2020] We will update UPOS in the SJMorph model based on a new mapping table in [kim-colineau:2020:LREC](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.472/) (to be announced). 

[new, September 2020] We present Korean NER based on the SJMorph model (to be announced). 

[July 2020] Using sjmorph_v3.model, we obtain 99.88% f1 score for token segmentation and 94.77% accuracy for POS tagging for Sejong tag sets. We also fixed encoding problems in macOS. For the newest model, please contact jungyeul (dot) park (at) gmail (dot) com.
